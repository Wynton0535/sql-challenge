# Data Engineering

Six tables were created to reflect the data from the six csv files provided. For this, data types, primary and foreign keys, and constrains were specified. 

# Data Analysis

For the Data Analysis, eight queries were looked at:

*1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee*

*2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986*

*3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name*

*4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name*

*5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B*

*6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name*

*7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name*

*8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)*
